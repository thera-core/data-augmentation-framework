## Data Augmentation Framework — Functional Requirements

### 1. Overview
The **Data Augmentation Framework** is responsible for fetching, transforming, and enriching datasets with additional context or metadata. It integrates with the **Context-Tracking Framework** to record provenance (who/what/when/why), ensuring that every transformation or augmentation is traceable.

### 2. Core Functional Requirements

1. **Augmenter Modules**  
   - **Requirement**: Implement modular “augmenters” that encapsulate different data-fetching or data-transformation processes (e.g., `PubMedAugmenter`, `GeneNormalizationAugmenter`).  
   - **Rationale**: Allows developers to add or remove augmentation features without affecting the rest of the system.  
   - **Criteria for Success**:  
     - Each augmenter is packaged as a self-contained class or module.  
     - New augmenters can be registered and discovered without modifying core library code.

2. **Integration with Context-Tracking**  
   - **Requirement**: Use the `context-framework` to log or retrieve metadata about every transformation.  
   - **Rationale**: All data transformations must be auditable.  
   - **Criteria for Success**:  
     - Each augmenter calls `adapter.add_context(...)` or an equivalent method to store provenance data.  
     - If transformations modify existing data, the context framework is updated accordingly (e.g., marking columns or rows with transformation details).

3. **Data Input/Output**  
   - **Requirement**: Accept multiple data formats (e.g., CSV, Pandas DataFrame, JSON, possibly Spark DataFrame in future phases).  
   - **Rationale**: The framework must handle real-world data structures commonly used by the end users or HPC pipelines.  
   - **Criteria for Success**:  
     - The framework provides a clear API for passing in data and receiving augmented data.  
     - Extensible support for future data structures via adapter patterns.

4. **External Data Sources**  
   - **Requirement**: Provide connectors or APIs to query external sources (e.g., PubMed, HPC servers, gene databases).  
   - **Rationale**: External references can enrich data with domain-specific metadata (e.g., retrieving gene annotations from NCBI).  
   - **Criteria for Success**:  
     - Source connectors handle authentication and throttling where needed (e.g., API tokens for PubMed).
     - Error handling and retries are built-in for network or server downtime.

5. **Caching Mechanism**  
   - **Requirement**: Provide optional caching for repeated queries.  
   - **Rationale**: Many augmentation tasks involve repeated lookups of the same data, so caching can significantly improve performance and reduce external API calls.  
   - **Criteria for Success**:  
     - The framework supports in-memory or external caches (Redis, local disk, etc.).  
     - Augmenters can specify caching policies (e.g., time-to-live, retrieval strategy).

6. **Concurrency & Batch Processing**  
   - **Requirement**: Offer a straightforward way to process data in chunks or in parallel (e.g., for HPC or large datasets).  
   - **Rationale**: Large-scale data sets require efficient resource usage to avoid slow or blocking calls.  
   - **Criteria for Success**:  
     - Augmenters or the core framework can handle parallel or distributed tasks.  
     - Clear documentation on how to configure thread pools or HPC job submission.

7. **Logging & Monitoring**  
   - **Requirement**: Provide logs for each augmentation event (time, data source, transformation type).  
   - **Rationale**: Detailed logs are crucial for debugging data workflows and ensuring reproducibility.  
   - **Criteria for Success**:  
     - Each call to an augmenter logs relevant details (start/end time, success/failure, context ID).  
     - Logging is configurable (log level, output destination).

### 3. Optional / Future-Facing Requirements

1. **Support for Advanced Data Adapters**  
   - Additional data formats (e.g., Seurat for single-cell genomics, Spark DataFrame for big data).  
2. **Plugin Architecture**  
   - Third-party or user-defined augmenters can be loaded at runtime without changing the core codebase.  
3. **Advanced Error Recovery**  
   - Automatic fallback or partial retries for large HPC transformations that fail mid-way.

### 4. User Story Examples

1. **User Story**: “As a research scientist, I want to automatically fetch PubMed abstracts for a list of gene identifiers so that I can have relevant biomedical context attached to my dataset.”  
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: The user can call a function like `PubMedAugmenter.augment_data(df, 'GeneID')`, which retrieves the relevant abstracts and appends them as metadata, storing the augmentation context.

2. **User Story**: “As a data engineer, I want to run chunked transformations on a large CSV (10+ million rows) without crashing my local machine.”  
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: The augmentation framework allows chunked processing (e.g., `chunk_size=10000`), logs each chunk’s progress, and merges the final result into a single context-aware data structure.
