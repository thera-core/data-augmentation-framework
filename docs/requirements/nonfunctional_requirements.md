## Data Augmentation Framework — Nonfunctional Requirements

### 1. Performance

1. **Efficient Data Handling**  
   - **Requirement**: The framework should handle moderate to large datasets (up to millions of rows) without prohibitive memory overhead.  
   - **Rationale**: Research or HPC workflows often involve sizable data sets.  
   - **Key Performance Indicators**:  
     - Processing speed per row or operation (e.g., <1 second for a single PubMed augmentation under typical network conditions).  
     - Memory usage relative to data size (supporting streaming or chunking as needed).

2. **Low Latency for Common Tasks**  
   - **Requirement**: For frequently repeated queries (e.g., gene symbol lookups), response times should be minimized via caching or concurrency.  
   - **Rationale**: Minimizing wait time improves user experience, especially in interactive sessions (such as a Discord-based AI assistant).  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - With caching enabled, repeated lookups for the same item <100 ms.

### 2. Scalability

1. **Horizontal Scalability**  
   - **Requirement**: The system should support parallel or distributed workflows, especially for HPC or cloud deployments.  
   - **Rationale**: Large-scale data augmentation (e.g., analyzing thousands of columns or millions of rows) may demand more processing power than a single node.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - The framework can run on multi-node clusters with minimal code changes.  
     - The concurrency model is documented and easily configurable.

2. **Modular Architecture**  
   - **Requirement**: The codebase must separate core functionalities (context logging, augmentation logic, concurrency management) so that each can scale independently if needed.  
   - **Rationale**: Different organizations or teams may have unique HPC or concurrency needs.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - Clear module boundaries.  
     - Ability to replace or extend concurrency modules without refactoring the entire codebase.

### 3. Reliability & Availability

1. **Fault Tolerance**  
   - **Requirement**: The framework should handle failures gracefully (e.g., network timeouts, HPC node failures), provide retries or partial rollbacks if feasible.  
   - **Rationale**: Long-running augmentation pipelines must not lose all progress due to a single failed request or node.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - Automatic retry attempts for transient errors.  
     - Clear error messages and rollback/logging on permanent failures.

2. **Stability Under Load**  
   - **Requirement**: The system remains responsive under heavy usage or large batch jobs.  
   - **Rationale**: Ensures that real-time or near-real-time augmentations (like a Discord-based user session) do not degrade significantly.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - The system can handle concurrent augmentation requests from multiple agents without crashing.  
     - Defined upper bounds for concurrency (e.g., max threads or HPC queue depth).

### 4. Maintainability

1. **Clean, Documented Codebase**  
   - **Requirement**: All public classes and functions must have docstrings and usage examples.  
   - **Rationale**: Facilitates onboarding of new contributors and fosters collaborative development.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - 90% or higher code documentation coverage.  
     - Automated style checks, linting, and unit tests in CI pipeline.

2. **Testability**  
   - **Requirement**: The framework must include unit tests, integration tests (for external APIs), and, when possible, mocks for external data sources.  
   - **Rationale**: Ensures each augmenter or feature is reliably verifiable.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - 80% or higher test coverage.  
     - Automated test runs on each commit with clear pass/fail reporting.

### 5. Security

1. **Secure External Connections**  
   - **Requirement**: Handling of external API keys or credentials for data sources must follow best security practices (e.g., environment variables, secret managers).  
   - **Rationale**: Protects sensitive credentials from leaks or unauthorized access.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - No hard-coded credentials in code.  
     - Integration with secret management solutions (Vault, environment variables, etc.).

2. **Protected Function Calls**  
   - **Requirement**: Potentially sensitive transformations or HPC calls (e.g., expensive GPU resources) should require the correct permissions or tokens.  
   - **Rationale**: Avoid unauthorized or malicious usage.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - Documented role-based access or admin checks.  
     - Code-level checks for privileged augmentations.

### 6. Usability

1. **Intuitive API**  
   - **Requirement**: Functions and classes in the augmentation framework should have straightforward method signatures, minimal boilerplate setup, and consistent naming conventions.  
   - **Rationale**: Data scientists and developers should quickly integrate the framework in their workflows.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - Minimal “getting started” steps (e.g., a single import + a few lines to run a standard augmentation).  
     - Positive user feedback or minimal confusion in user testing.

2. **Clear Error Reporting**  
   - **Requirement**: Any augmentation failure or invalid input should produce descriptive errors (e.g., “Invalid column name” instead of a generic stack trace).  
   - **Rationale**: Accelerates debugging and reduces user frustration.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - Error messages provide guidance on fixing the issue (e.g., missing columns, unavailable HPC node, invalid credentials).

### 7. Extensibility

1. **Adding New Augmenters**  
   - **Requirement**: The design should make it easy to introduce new augmentation classes with minimal changes to the existing codebase.  
   - **Rationale**: Encourages community or domain experts to contribute specialized augmenters.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - Creation of a new augmenter typically involves inheriting from a base class or implementing a well-documented interface.  
     - No major refactoring needed to add new functionality.

2. **Future HPC/Framework Support**  
   - **Requirement**: The system should be ready to incorporate new technologies (GPU-based transformations, Spark, Dask, seurat, etc.)  
   - **Rationale**: Data science evolves quickly; the framework must remain adaptable.  
   - **KPIs**:  
     - The concurrency or HPC layers are modular and can be swapped without a complete rewrite.  
     - New HPC transformations can be registered as augmenters.
